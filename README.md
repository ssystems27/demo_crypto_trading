# Crypto Auto-Trading Demo – VWAP & Z-Score Strategy

This project is a beginner-level automated trading system built in Python.  
It demonstrates the core logic behind algorithmic trading using VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and Z-Score mean reversion strategy.

Strategy Overview

- VWAP is used to track the fair price of an asset over time.
- Z-Score measures how far current price deviates from its mean, helping detect potential reversal points.
- This combination creates a simple trading logic where the system buys/sells based on how far price deviates from the VWAP.

Features

- Python OOP structure
- Simple signal generation for buy/sell decisions
- Designed for crypto price data
- Can be extended into real-time bot with API integration (e.g., Binance)

Technologies Used

- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- Numpy
- VWAP & Z-score logic

Status

> Educational demo – Built as part of my journey to master algorithmic trading with Python  
> Future upgrades may include:
> - Live exchange data
> - API trade execution
> - Risk management modules
